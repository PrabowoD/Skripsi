	abstract = {The classical, vector space model for text retrieval is shown to
	            give better results (up to 29\% better in our experiments) if
	            WordNet synsets are chosen as the indexing space, instead of word
	            forms. This result is obtained for a manually disambiguated test
	            collection (of queries and documents) derived from the Semcor
	            semantic concordance. The sensitivity of retrieval performance to
	            (automatic) disambiguation errors when indexing documents is also
	            measured. Finally, it is observed that if queries are not
	            disambiguated, indexing by synsets performs (at best) only as good
	            as standard word indexing.},

	abstract = {PEP 3107 introduced syntax for function annotations, but the
	            semantics were deliberately left undefined. There has now been
	            enough 3rd party usage for static type analysis that the community
	            would benefit from a standard vocabulary and baseline tools within
	            the standard library. This PEP introduces a provisional module to
	            provide these standard definitions and tools, along with some
	            conventions for situations where annotations are not available.
	            Note that this PEP still explicitly does NOT prevent other uses of
	            annotations, nor does it require (or forbid) any particular
	            processing of annotations, even when they conform to this
	            specification. It simply enables better coordination, as PEP 333
	            did for web frameworks.},
